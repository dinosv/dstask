# Future of dstask

There are a few things missing at the moment. That said I use dstask day to day and trust it with my work.

* Subtask/checklist implementation (github check list style)
* Recurring tasks

Project management features:

* Task dependencies
* Deferred/scheduled tasks with duration
* Due/deadline dates
* Maybe a gantt display

After these features are implemented, I might add CalDav integration to
enable:

* Display of recurring tasks
* Display of appointments/meetings
* Display of deadlines
* Display of resolved tasks (maybe, separate calendar)
* Possible creation of time based tasks from calendar

This could work by acting as a client to add/update/remove appointments, or a server to provide them.
